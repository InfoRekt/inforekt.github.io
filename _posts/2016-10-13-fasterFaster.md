		OK, so now try to think why this looks so idiotic. Someone decided to go "faster" than they actually should. See the resemblance?

		By compromising in such terms, you not only risk failing as a product, but more importantly you risk failing the trust of your customers. Keep in mind the following basic principles people, and stop trying to rush things.

		After all, it's better to be safe than sorry
