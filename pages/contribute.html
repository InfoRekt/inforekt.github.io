So, you want to contribute? Awesome! <img src="/static/img/banana.gif" height="24" width="24"> Your article can be in any style you prefer as long as you keep in mind that:
<li>It has to be somehow about information security;
<li>It needs to have advice on where they went wrong and what they should have done;
<li>Sarcasm, condesending tone or funny writing style are <u>optional</u> but appreciated, we are not a very serious site.
<p>
There are two obvious ways to do that:
<p>
<h2>1. Submit a pull request</h2>
The best way to submit an article is to create a pull request on our <a href="https://github.com/InfoRekt/inforekt.github.io">github repo</a>. 
You do this by forking the repository and create a new article in the <i>_posts</i> directory. Keep in mind that the headers in the posts that 
are already there also need to be included in your article. <br>
<p>
If this is your first submission you should also create an author <i>page</i>. It's strongly suggested to not use any personal information
in the author page, unless you prefer this.<br>
<p>
Once you have done this create a pull request and wait for feedback or merge.
<p>
<h2>2. Email</h2>
The other method is by email. You can email <a href="mailto:cpthindsight@inforekt.fail">cpthindsight@inforekt.fail</a> with your story. You will
need to send us your story in txt or html format. This can be both inside the email or as uncompressed attachment. <br>
Zip, Rar, Word, LaTeX, PDF or any other format is not acceptable and will be ignored.
<p><br><p>
<font color="red">Note</font>: if you only want to submit a link to an article you want something written about you should hop over to our freenode #inforekt channel.
You don't need an IRC client for this, you can just use the <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net">Freenode Webchat</a> and fill in the channel edit box with #inforekt. Another option is to just send us a DM or tweet at our twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/0xinforekt">0xInfoRekt</a>.
