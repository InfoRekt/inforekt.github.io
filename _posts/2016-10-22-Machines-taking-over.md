<blockquote>An Army of Million Hacked IoT Devices Almost Broke the Internet Today</blockquote>

		The whole topic today is of course the DDOS that happened against a major DNS provider that brought many other services to their knees.
	</p>
	<p>
		To begin with, do we even have to explain what the internet is? With phrases such as that one, I'm imagining hackers with axes trying to cut down cables running between continents or something.
		Sophisticated attack? Advanced malware?

		No, it's a lot simplier than that. There were no sophisticated attacks, zero days, or anything of the sorts. Simply put, default credentials on poorly set up devices were used to bring down poorly set up infrastructure.
	</p>
	<p>
		On one side, we've got these so called IOT devices. People want pretty much everything connected to the internet. However, manufacturers use pretty easy passwords and people using these devices don't change them either by choice or because of lack of the ability to change them. My reply to these things can only be:

		*A proposed solution for manufacturers you say? Make those fucking devices not operate until a proper password is set up, and use up to date software. It's not that difficult is it?
		*And a proposed solution for the users of such devices? For the love of god, use a proper passowrd, and no, your birth date or a name or a day's name or something like that is not "proper".
	</p>
	<p>
		On the other side, we've got those services that were brought down by such an attack. It's year 2016, you are a major service provider out there, but you are using one DNS provider and haven't considered DNS redundancy? It's hard to believe that the porn industry did, what other major players like Github or Twitter didn't.

		Well after all that just verifies that indeed internet is for porn. kekek
	</p>
	<p>
		From the looks of it, we are far from mature for IOT and the providers out there have very basic things to consider and problems to solve when it comes to their services.
	</p>
	<p>		
		Some years ago, if anyone said that in the future, hackers will be discussing how a bunch of hair dryers brought down the internet, people would call him crazy, however, have we come to a point where as infosec professionals, our advirseries are these?
