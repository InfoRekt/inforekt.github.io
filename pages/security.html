<h2>Reporting security issues</h2>
We know security is important; that's what this site is all about after all. But we also know that people make mistakes and not everyone can see and fix every single mistake that can be made.<br/><p>
That's why we would appreciate it if you would report any vulnerabilities found in this page, system or host to us. If it's not critical please email us at <a href="mailto:security@inforekt.fail">security@inforekt.fail</a> and give as much details as you can. If it is critical, please send us a DM on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/0xInfoRekt">@0xInfoRekt</a> for better and encrypted contact details.<br/>
<p>
We will publicly thank you for your report after the issue has been fixed, and your name will be added to the special thanks section at the bottom of this page.<br/>

<h2>Special thanks</h2>
Inforekt.fail would specifically and especially like to thank the following people and/or companies:<br/>
